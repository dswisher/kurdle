## Generator ##

- Need to copy images, styles, etc.
- Process .gitignore files to avoid dirs we don't want to see
- Should (optionally) minify JS
- Should bundle javascript (and perhaps css)
- The relative path to the script directory should be part of DocumentModel
- The relative path to the "main" image directory should be part of DocumentModel
- Switch project.dat file to [YAML](http://yaml.org/)


## Other Markup ##

- [AsciiDoc](http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/)?
- Look at the [lightweight markup language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_markup_language) page on Wikipedia for ideas
